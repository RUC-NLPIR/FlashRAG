[24/09/18] Due to the complexity and limitations of installing Pyserini in certain environments, we have introduced a lightweight `BM25s` package as an alternative (faster and easier to use). The retriever based on Pyserini will be deprecated in future versions. To use retriever with `bm25s`, just set `bm25_backend` to `bm25s` in config.

[24/09/09] We add support for a new method [<u>Adaptive-RAG</u>](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.389.pdf), which can automatically select the RAG process to execute based on the type of query. See it result in [<u>result table</u>](#robot-supporting-methods).

[24/08/02] We add support for a new method [<u>Spring</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19670), significantly improve the performance of LLM by adding only a few token embeddings. See it result in [<u>result table</u>](#robot-supporting-methods).

[24/07/17] Due to some unknown issues with HuggingFace, our original dataset link has been invalid. We have updated it. Please check the [new link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG_datasets/) if you encounter any problems.

[24/07/06] We add support for a new method: [<u>Trace</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11460), which refine text by constructing a knowledge graph. See it [<u>results</u>](#robot-supporting-methods) and [<u>details</u>](./docs/baseline_details.md).

## :wrench: Installation

To get started with FlashRAG, you can simply install it with pip:

```base
pip install flashrag-dev --pre
```

Or you can clone it from Github and install (requires Python 3.10+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG.git
cd FlashRAG
pip install -e .
```

If you want to use vllm, sentence-transformers or pyserini, you can install the optional dependencies:

```bash
# Install all extra dependencies
pip install flashrag[full]

# Install vllm for faster speed
pip install vllm>=0.4.1

# Install sentence-transformers
pip install sentence-transformers

# Install pyserini for bm25
pip install pyserini
```

Due to the incompatibility when installing `faiss` using `pip`, it is necessary to use the following conda command for installation.

```bash
# CPU-only version
conda install -c pytorch faiss-cpu=1.8.0

# GPU(+CPU) version
conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia faiss-gpu=1.8.0
```

Note: It is impossible to install the latest version of `faiss` on certain systems.

From the official Faiss repository ([source](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/blob/main/INSTALL.md)):

> - The CPU-only faiss-cpu conda package is currently available on Linux (x86_64 and arm64), OSX (arm64 only), and Windows (x86_64)
> - faiss-gpu, containing both CPU and GPU indices, is available on Linux (x86_64 only) for CUDA 11.4 and 12.1

## :rocket: Quick Start

### Corpus Construction
To build an index, you first need to save your corpus as a `jsonl` file with each line representing a document.

```jsonl
{"id": "0", "contents": "..."}
{"id": "1", "contents": "..."}
```

If you want to use Wikipedia as your corpus, you can refer to our documentation [Processing Wikipedia](./docs/process-wiki.md) to convert it into an indexable format.

### Index Construction

You can use the following code to build your own index.

* For **dense retrieval methods**, especially popular embedding models, we use `faiss` to build the index.

* For **sparse retrieval methods (BM25)**, we use `Pyserini` or `bm25s` to build the corpus into a Lucene inverted index. The built index contains the original documents.

#### For Dense Retrieval Methods

Modify the parameters in the following code to your own.

```bash
python -m flashrag.retriever.index_builder \
  --retrieval_method e5 \
  --model_path /model/e5-base-v2/ \
  --corpus_path indexes/sample_corpus.jsonl \
  --save_dir indexes/ \
  --use_fp16 \
  --max_length 512 \
  --batch_size 256 \
  --pooling_method mean \
  --faiss_type Flat 
```

* ```--pooling_method```: If this parameter is not specified, we will automatically select it based on the model name and model file. However, since different embedding models use different pooling methods, **we may not have fully implemented them**. To ensure accuracy, you can **specify the pooling method corresponding to the retrieval model you are using** (`mean`, `pooler`, or `cls`).

* ```---instruction```: Some embedding models require additional instructions to be concatenated to the query before encoding, which can be specified here. Currently, we will automatically fill in the instructions for **E5** and **BGE** models, while other models need to be supplemented manually.

If the retrieval model supports the `sentence transformers` library, you can use the following code to build the index (**without considering the pooling method**).

```bash
python -m flashrag.retriever.index_builder \
  --retrieval_method e5 \
  --model_path /model/e5-base-v2/ \
  --corpus_path indexes/sample_corpus.jsonl \
  --save_dir indexes/ \
  --use_fp16 \
  --max_length 512 \
  --batch_size 256 \
  --pooling_method mean \
  --sentence_transformer \
  --faiss_type Flat 
```

#### For Sparse Retrieval Methods (BM25)

If building a bm25 index, there is no need to specify `model_path`.

##### Building Index with BM25s

```bash
python -m flashrag.retriever.index_builder \
  --retrieval_method bm25 \
  --corpus_path indexes/sample_corpus.jsonl \
  --bm25_backend bm25s \
  --save_dir indexes/ 
```

##### Building Index with Pyserini

```bash
python -m flashrag.retriever.index_builder \
  --retrieval_method bm25 \
  --corpus_path indexes/sample_corpus.jsonl \
  --bm25_backend pyserini \
  --save_dir indexes/ 
```

### Using the ready-made pipeline

You can use the pipeline class we have already built (as shown in [<u>pipelines</u>](#pipelines)) to implement the RAG process inside. In this case, you just need to configure the config and load the corresponding pipeline.

Firstly, load the entire process's config, which records various hyperparameters required in the RAG process. You can input yaml files as parameters or directly as variables.

Please note that **variables as input take precedence over files**.

```python
from flashrag.config import Config

# hybrid load configs
config_dict = {'data_dir': 'dataset/'}
my_config = Config(
    config_file_path = 'my_config.yaml',
    config_dict = config_dict
```

We provide comprehensive guidance on how to set configurations, you can see our [<u>configuration guidance</u>](./docs/configuration.md).
You can also refer to the [<u>basic yaml file</u>](./flashrag/config/basic_config.yaml) we provide to set your own parameters.

Next, load the corresponding dataset and initialize the pipeline. The components in the pipeline will be automatically loaded.

```python
from flashrag.utils import get_dataset
from flashrag.pipeline import SequentialPipeline
from flashrag.prompt import PromptTemplate
from flashrag.config import Config

config_dict = {'data_dir': 'dataset/'}
my_config = Config(
    config_file_path = 'my_config.yaml',
    config_dict = config_dict
)
all_split = get_dataset(my_config)
test_data = all_split['test']

pipeline = SequentialPipeline(my_config)
```

You can specify your own input prompt using `PromptTemplete`:

```python
prompt_templete = PromptTemplate(
    config,
    system_prompt = "Answer the question based on the given document. Only give me the answer and do not output any other words.\nThe following are given documents.\n\n{reference}",
    user_prompt = "Question: {question}\nAnswer:"
)
pipeline = SequentialPipeline(
  my_config,
  prompt_template = prompt_templete
)
```

Finally, execute `pipeline.run` to obtain the final result.

```python
output_dataset = pipeline.run(test_data, do_eval=True)
```

The `output_dataset` contains the intermediate results and metric scores for each item in the input dataset.
Meanwhile, the dataset with intermediate results and the overall evaluation score will also be saved as a file (if `save_intermediate_data` and `save_metric_score` are specified).

### Build your own pipeline!

Sometimes you may need to implement more complex RAG process, and you can build your own pipeline to implement it.
You just need to inherit `BasicPipeline`, initialize the components you need, and complete the `run` function.

```python
from flashrag.pipeline import BasicPipeline
from flashrag.utils import get_retriever, get_generator

class ToyPipeline(BasicPipeline):
  def __init__(self, config, prompt_templete=None):
    # Load your own components
    pass

  def run(self, dataset, do_eval=True):
    # Complete your own process logic

    # get attribute in dataset using `.`
    input_query = dataset.question
    ...
    # use `update_output` to save intermeidate data
    dataset.update_output("pred",pred_answer_list)
    dataset = self.evaluate(dataset, do_eval=do_eval)
    return dataset
```

Please first understand the input and output forms of the components you need to use from our [<u>documentation</u>](./docs/basic_usage.md).

### Just use components

If you already have your own code and only want to use our components to embed the original code, you can refer to the [<u>basic introduction of the components</u>](./docs/basic_usage.md) to obtain the input and output formats of each component.

## :gear: Components

In FlashRAG, we have built a series of common RAG components, including retrievers, generators, refiners, and more. Based on these components, we have assembled several pipelines to implement the RAG workflow, while also providing the flexibility to combine these components in custom arrangements to create your own pipeline.

#### Pipelines

Referring to a [<u>survey on retrieval-augmented generation</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10997), we categorized RAG methods into four types based on their inference paths.

- **Sequential**: Sequential execuation of RAG process, like Query-(pre-retrieval)-retriever-(post-retrieval)-generator
- **Conditional**: Implements different paths for different types of input queries
- **Branching** : Executes multiple paths in parallel, merging the responses from each path
- **Loop**: Iteratively performs retrieval and generation

In each category, we have implemented corresponding common pipelines. Some pipelines have corresponding work papers.

## :robot: Supporting Methods

We have implemented 15 works with a consistent setting of:

- **Generator:** LLAMA3-8B-instruct with input length of 2048
- **Retriever:** e5-base-v2 as embedding model, retrieve 5 docs per query
- **Prompt:** A consistent default prompt, template can be found in the [<u>method details</u>](./docs/baseline_details.md).

For open-source methods, we implemented their processes using our framework. For methods where the author did not provide source code, we will try our best to follow the methods in the original paper for implementation.

For necessary settings and hyperparameters specific to some methods, we have documented them in the **specific settings** column. For more details, please consult our [<u>reproduce guidance</u>](./docs/reproduce_experiment.md) and [<u>method details</u>](./docs/baseline_details.md).

It’s important to note that, to ensure consistency, we have utilized a uniform setting. However, this setting may differ from the original setting of the method, leading to variations in results compared to the original outcomes.

## :notebook: Supporting Datasets & Document Corpus

### Datasets

We have collected and processed 36 datasets widely used in RAG research, pre-processing them to ensure a consistent format for ease of use. For certain datasets (such as Wiki-asp), we have adapted them to fit the requirements of RAG tasks according to the methods commonly used within the community. All datasets are available at [<u>Huggingface datasets</u>](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG_datasets).

For each dataset, we save each split as a `jsonl` file, and each line is a dict as follows:

```python
{
  'id': str,
  'question': str,
  'golden_answers': List[str],
  'metadata': dict
}
```

Below is the list of datasets along with the corresponding sample sizes:

### Document Corpus

Our toolkit supports jsonl format for retrieval document collections, with the following structure:

```jsonl
{"id":"0", "contents": "..."}
{"id":"1", "contents": "..."}
```

The `contents` key is essential for building the index. For documents that include both text and title, we recommend setting the value of `contents` to `{title}\n{text}`. The corpus file can also contain other keys to record additional characteristics of the documents.

In the academic research, Wikipedia and MS MARCO are the most commonly used retrieval document collections. For Wikipedia, we provide a [<u>comprehensive script</u>](./docs/process-wiki.md) to process any Wikipedia dump into a clean corpus. Additionally, various processed versions of the Wikipedia corpus are available in many works, and we have listed some reference links.

For MS MARCO, it is already processed upon release and can be directly downloaded from its [<u>hosting link</u>](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tevatron/msmarco-passage-corpus) on Hugging Face.

### Index

To facilitate easier replication of the experiments, we now provide a preprocessed index available in the ModelScope dataset page: [FlashRAG_Dataset/retrieval_corpus/wiki18_100w_e5_index.zip](https://www.modelscope.cn/datasets/hhjinjiajie/FlashRAG_Dataset/file/view/master?id=47985&status=2&fileName=retrieval_corpus%252Fwiki18_100w_e5_index.zip).

The index was created using the e5-base-v2 retriever on our uploaded wiki18_100w dataset, which is consistent with the index used in our experiments.
